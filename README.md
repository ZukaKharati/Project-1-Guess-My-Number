# **Number Guessing Game 🎯**

This is an interactive game based on JavaScript, where the user can guess a random number from 1 to 20.

## 📋 Project description

In the game, the user tries to guess a random hidden number (from 1 to 20). The user has 20 attempts. After each attempt, the web page shows whether their guess is correct or how close they are to the target.

### Main functionality:

• Random number generation in the range 1-20.

• Guessing mechanism:

           • If the entered number is less, the message: Too Low! appears.
           • If more – the message: Too High!.
           • If nothing is specified – the message: No Number!.

• Win: The user receives the message 🎉 Correct Number!, the site design changes.

• Failure: After 20 attempts, the message 💥 You lost the game! appears, and the game ends.

• HighScore function: The user's best result is stored.

### 🛠️ Technologies used
• HTML – the structure of a web page
